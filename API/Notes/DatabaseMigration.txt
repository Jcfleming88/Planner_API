# Database Migration Notes

With the EF Core migration tool, you can now generate your first migration, InitialCreate. Save all your changes, and then run the following command:


###Console
```
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
```

EF Core creates a Migrations folder in your project directory that contains two files with the code that represents the database migrations.

Now that you've completed the migration, you can use it to create your database and schema.

In a terminal window, run the following database update command to apply migrations to a database:

###Console
```
dotnet ef database update
```
